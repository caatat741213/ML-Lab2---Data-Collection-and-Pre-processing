# ML Lab 2 - Data Collection and Pre-processing

### Project Synopsis
This project establishes an automated data engineering pipeline that integrates primary sales records with secondary e-commerce market metadata. By applying advanced cleaning, regex-based transformations, and profitability feature engineering, the system converts raw legacy data into actionable strategic insights for market performance analysis.

### Quick-start
1. **Initialize Virtual Environment**: `python -m venv lab2venv`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Launch Notebook**: `jupyter notebook` and open `Lab2_DataCollectionandPreprocessing.ipynb`.

### Data-Source Attribution
* **Primary Data**: [Sample Sales Records](https://excelbianalytics.com/downloads-18-sample-csv-files-data-sets-for-testing-sales/) - Historical transaction datasets for testing.
* **Secondary Metadata**: [E-commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/e-commerce-dataset) - Sourced from Kaggle for market discount benchmarking.
